## Proposal(draft):
_This project aims to investigate survival outcomes in a pressing women’s health issue, emphasizing the demographic and biological factors that shape disease prognosis and health equity._

**Primary Topic: Breast Cancer Survival and Risk Patterns**  
  Breast cancer remains one of the most prevalent disease worldwide, accounting for a substantial proportion of cancer incidence and health burden. Despite advances in early detection and treatment, disparities in outcomes is often suggested across demographic and biological groups. Clinical outcomes are influenced by multiple factors, including tumor size, stage, lymph node involvement, and hormone recpeotor status. 

  Understanding how patient characteristics, tumor biology, and receptor profiles influence survival and risk is essential for improving risk stratification and guide treatment decisions. This project aims to explore the relationship between factors predicting surivial outcome amoung patients who have breast cancer. 
  
  
_This project starts with a public, de-identified dataset derived from the 2017 SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) Program, containing information from 4,024 breast cancer cases with 16 demographic, clinical, and molecular variables. The data include survival time, tumor stage and grade, hormone receptor status, lymph node involvement, and other key prognostic factors._

  In further investigation, usage of this dataset or a full SEER dataset with more detailed covariates would be considered.  The main goal is to explore survival differences by demographic group, tumor characteristics, and receptor status, as well as broader examination of disease burden and disparities in breast cancer outcomes. 

  The project may also incorporate publicly available SEER incidence data (1975–2022) to contextualize survival findings within trends in breast cancer occurrence and population-level risk patterns over time.

_If SEER data set is not applicable or not informative, an alternative plan would be applied._  

**Alternative Topic: Infant and Maternal Mortality in the United States**  
  As an alternative or complementary direction, this project may investigate patterns and disparities in infant and maternal mortality using national data from the CDC/NCHS Birth–Infant Death and Maternal Mortality datasets. These datasets provide detailed demographic and health information on mothers and infants across the United States, offering a rich foundation for understanding the social, economic, and medical determinants of survival in early life and maternal health.

  This topic is of major public health importance, as both infant and maternal mortality reflect the overall effectiveness of healthcare systems, access to care, and equity in health outcomes. Analyses could focus on identifying demographic patterns, geographic disparities, and population subgroups at elevated risk, contributing to ongoing national efforts to reduce preventable deaths and improve maternal–child health outcomes.

**Project Vision**

  Both directions align closely with the goals of applied epidemiologic and data science research. The overarching aim is to use population data to describe health disparities across female health burden and systematic determinants. With this project, we aim to identify key determinants of disease outcomes, and highlight areas for intervention. By integrating data management, exploratory insight, and public health relevance, this project will contribute to understanding critical patterns in population health and inform future work in epidemiology and health equity.
